        <p>We are an independent creative studio with zero ambition to sell or grow big. Our space is one room in an ex-squat in the east of Amsterdam. Everyone sits together and the rent is cheap - so no huge overheads passed onto clients. Our bottom line isn’t driven by money but investing our time in projects we are passionate about.</p>

        <p>Please note we aren’t interested in our own fame versus that of brands - making work people talk about rather than overly talking about ourselves. We are an escape pod from the echo chamber of industry forums and award shows. So if you are up for creating great stuff we’d genuinely love to hear from you, clients and creatives alike.</p>

        <p>The type of work we aspire to is stuff that makes people feel something. In whatever medium moves them. If an idea doesn’t hold that potential please save your money, plus the planet, from generating more mental landfill. But if you want to make a dent in culture + grab a plot of real estate in people’s minds hopefully we can help.</p>

        <p>NeverHeardOfStu was previously CD/ECD at W+K/72andSunny, doing stuff like Write The Future. NeverHeardOfDan has been making things at Google Creative Lab and R/GA. That was then. This is now. They run things speedboat-esque as a small and nimble tight-knit crew, collaborating with a global network of talented cohorts, when needed.</p>
